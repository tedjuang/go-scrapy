# API Versioning Strategy

## Overview

We've chosen to use URI path versioning for the Scrapy API to ensure backward compatibility as the API evolves.

## Strategy

All API endpoints include a version prefix in the form of:

```
/api/v{major_version}/{resource}
```

For example:

- `/api/v1/products`
- `/api/v1/products/{id}`

## Versioning Rules

1. **Major Version Increments**: The major version number (v1, v2, etc.) will be incremented when making backward-incompatible changes to the API.

2. **Adding Features**: New features or endpoints can be added to the current version without incrementing the version number, as long as they don't break existing clients.

3. **Deprecation Process**: Before removing or significantly changing an endpoint in a new major version, the endpoint will be marked as deprecated in the current version for a reasonable time period.

## Version Support

- We maintain support for at least the two most recent API versions.
- Deprecated versions will be announced with a timeline for retirement.
- The current stable version is v1.

## Documentation

Each API version has its own documentation:

- Swagger/OpenAPI specification
- API reference documentation
- Example requests and responses

## Future Considerations

As the API grows, we may consider more sophisticated versioning approaches such as:

- Content negotiation using Accept headers
- Version-specific media types
- Feature flags for fine-grained versioning
